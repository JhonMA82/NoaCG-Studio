// The server-side entitlement loader: rows in, one resolved Entitlement out.
//
// It does no deciding. Precedence, expiry, suspension and the source labels all live in the
// pure contract (src/entitlements/contract.ts), which the browser and the tests use too;
// this module's whole job is fetching the four inputs that contract needs and handing them
// over. Splitting it that way is what keeps "why does this user have access" answerable with
// the same code that granted it.
//
// FAILURE POSTURE: every load failure degrades to the built-in defaults rather than throwing.
// A deployment with no Supabase configuration has no plans to read and must keep working
// exactly as it does today; a deployment whose database is briefly unreachable must not start
// refusing renders because a plans lookup timed out. Both land on DEFAULT_SIGNED_IN_PLAN,
// which is today's behaviour written down - so the degraded answer is the correct answer.
//
// It is also NOT the sign-in check. Callers resolve for whoever they already authenticated:
// pass null for an anonymous request and the anonymous defaults come back.
