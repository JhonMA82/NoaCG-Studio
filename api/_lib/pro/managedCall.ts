// What binds a MANAGED NoaCG Pro model call to its allowance.
//
// The generic proxy (api/ai/generate.ts) is where Pro's money is actually spent, because the
// pipeline that decides what to ask for runs in the browser. So the proxy is where the
// reservation has to be checked - anywhere else and `surface: 'pro'` would remain what its own
// comment admits it is today: a client-supplied label that gates an entitlement and nothing
// else. With this, a Pro call on NoaCG's key costs a reservation, the reservation costs a
// quota, and the quota is decided in the database.
//
// BYO IS UNTOUCHED. A caller spending their own key on their own chosen model is not ours to
// meter, the same line the disabled-route switch and the surface routing policy already draw.

/**
 * Is a Pro allowance ENFORCEABLE on this deployment at all?
 *
 * It needs an accounts backend (to know whose allowance) and the ledger (to hold it). A
 * self-hosted instance with a gateway key and no Supabase has neither, and there is nothing
 * for a reservation requirement to buy there - only every managed Pro call refused, on a box
 * whose operator owns the key and the bill. So that deployment is left exactly as it was:
 * the entitlement gate, the burst limiter, the disabled-route switch, and nothing new.
 *
 * Where the ledger DOES exist, the requirement binds whether or not hosted Pro is switched
 * on, and `admitManagedProCall` refuses an unenabled profile rather than serving it. That
 * asymmetry is the point: on a deployment that can meter Pro spend, unmetered Pro spend on
 * the managed key is the open tap this whole route exists to close.

 * Settle what the call actually cost into its reservation.

 * settlement the row still carries the reservation's conservative worst case, so a call that
 * threw before the provider billed anything leaves the fleet OVER-booked rather than
 * under-booked - the safe direction - and leaves the next call admissible, which is correct
 * because nothing was spent.
 *
 * A FAILING SETTLEMENT MUST NOT FAIL THE REQUEST. By the time this runs the provider has
 * answered and the money is gone, so throwing would hand the caller a 500 for work they were
 * already billed for - and the natural response to a 500 is to retry, which spends it again.
 * The ledger write is warned about and dropped, like the gateway ledger's own
 * (`recordGatewayRequest`).
 *
 * What that costs is bounded and worth stating. A lost FIRST settlement leaves the row holding
 * the reservation's conservative worst case, so the fleet is over-booked rather than under -
 * the safe direction. A lost later one under-counts by that call's cost, so the ceiling admits
 * at most one more call than it should, and `maxCallsPerGeneration` still stops the run.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT, stated rather than discovered later: a provider that answers without a cost
 * figure settles as zero, exactly as `proSpendExceeds` reads an unset cost. That is a reason
 * to keep every Pro route inside the audited catalog, where the price is known, which is what
 * `proRouteFunded` above enforces.
