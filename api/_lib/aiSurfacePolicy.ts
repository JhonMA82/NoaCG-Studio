// The MANAGED-KEY routing policy for a tagged gateway surface.
//
// `POST /api/ai/generate` is a general model proxy and has always called
// `executeGatewayRequest(body, { keyFor })` with no policy at all - so the SPX harness, the
// brainstorm call, the video harness and NoaCG Pro all reached the managed gateway without
// asking for zero-data-retention routing. The profile-owning surfaces
// (api/_lib/aiLiteProfile.ts, api/_lib/aiImportAnalysisProfile.ts) build a policy of their own
// and always have; everything reached through the generic proxy did not.
//
// That gap is only visible from the OUTSIDE once a route's ZDR is claimed as audited: putting
// "ZDR verified: yes" on the /admin Models page while the requests go out unpolicied would be a
// privacy claim production does not honour. This module is what makes the claim true.
//
// TWO DELIBERATE LIMITS, stated rather than discovered later:
//
//   1. MANAGED ONLY. A caller spending their OWN key on their own chosen model is not ours to
//      route - the same line api/ai/generate.ts already draws for the disabled-route switch.
//   2. THE TAG IS CLIENT-SUPPLIED. A request that omits `surface` gets no policy, exactly as
//      it gets no entitlement check (docs/ADMIN.md, "Gating a surface on a shared endpoint").
//      What this buys is real - the product's own Pro traffic is policied - and it is not a
//      guarantee about a hand-rolled request, which no server-side signal could provide.

/**
 * The gateway policy for a managed call on `surface`, or undefined for an unpoliced one.

 * TWO OPENROUTER DIRECTIVES DIED HERE, both harmlessly. `require_parameters` was already
 * false on this surface (an image request carries `modalities`, which is not a listed
 * provider parameter, so requiring parameters narrowed the endpoint set to nothing and failed
 * every concept call) and has no gateway equivalent to keep. `allow_fallbacks: false` is
 * subsumed: the gateway serves a `zeroDataRetention` request only from providers under a
 * verified ZDR agreement, so there is no non-ZDR path to fall back onto.
 *
 * The PRICE CAPS are the real loss. `FUNDED_ROUTE_PRICE_CEILING` used to ride on every Pro
 * call as `max_price`, so a route that got expensive was refused by the provider; the gateway
 * has no such field. `sort: 'cost'` asks for the cheapest eligible provider, and the ceiling
 * still gates which routes may be catalogued at all - but nothing refuses a call at request
 * time any more. That was never a bound on image work in any case: no ceiling for image
 * tokens has been decided (docs/ADMIN.md §9).

/**
 * The EXECUTION policy for a surface - attempt budget, timeout - as opposed to the routing
 * policy above. Undefined for every surface but the spike, so nothing else changes.
 *
 * WHY THE SPIKE NEEDS ONE. `configuredTimeoutMs()` clamps the shared default to 300 s, which
 * is right for the product: every managed surface answers a user who is waiting. The Phase 0
 * spike answers nobody - it is a background bench run - and the checkpoints it measures are
 * REASONING models. Measured 2026-08-11 on `zai/glm-5.2` against a 306-token prompt: 190 s and
 * 10,671 output tokens, of which **8,607 were reasoning** before a single character of the
 * answer. The spike's own prompt carries a 38,500-token exemplar block and asks for three
 * complete files, so 300 s refuses a call the model would have served - which is what the
 * first attempt at this round measured, 24 times, as "the AI provider timed out".
 *
 * Raising the shared clamp instead would lengthen how long a real user's failing generation
 * hangs on every surface, to fix a bench rig. This is the containment.
 *
 * `retryLimit: 0` is the other half and it is about money, not patience. A timeout is
 * classified retryable, so the default of one retry makes every slow call cost TWO full
 * provider completions - and a call we abandoned still ran to completion upstream, so the
 * waste is real spend with nothing to show for it. A bench run would rather fail a brief and
 * record it than pay twice for the same answer.
