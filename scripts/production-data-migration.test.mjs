//
// THE ONE THAT EARNS ITS PLACE is the conformance binding: the merge is implemented twice, in
// TypeScript and in plpgsql, and the migration's self-check runs a jsonb literal of the shared
// table from scripts/merge-patch-conformance.mjs. Nothing stops those two copies drifting except
// this file - so adding a case to the shared table fails the build until 0048 carries it too.
//
// The rest are the cheap structural checks the repo has learned to want: a SECURITY DEFINER
// function in `public` is exposed the moment it is created (see definer-grants.test.mjs), and a
// self-check that only reads catalogs proves shape rather than behaviour, so 0048 must actually
// CALL every body it adds.
