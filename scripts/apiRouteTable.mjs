// WHICH api/ FUNCTION SERVES A PATH - derived from the tree, so nothing keeps a copy in step.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Every dev middleware that mounts the real api/ handlers has to decide
// two things: is this path routable at all, and which function file answers it. `aiDevPlugin`
// answered the first from a hand-kept ALLOWLIST, and that list has now hidden a whole surface
// three times - the imported-graphic-analysis task, hosted Pro (a dev 404 in every dev server
// and the entire e2e suite while production served it), and `/api/ai/consent`, which no dev
// server has ever routed. `adminDevPlugin` and `meDevPlugin` already refuse to keep a list, and
// say why: "a second copy in the dev server would be a second thing to keep in step". They can
// simply forward everything because each mounts ONE function. `api/ai` mounts four, so the
// choice cannot be skipped - it has to be DERIVED instead.
//
// THE RULE IS THE DEPLOYMENT'S, MEASURED, NOT VERCEL'S DOCUMENTATION. A `[...path].ts` function
// under api/ routes exactly ONE segment; anything deeper never reaches code and gets the
// platform's own NOT_FOUND. `scripts/check-api-route-depth.mjs` records the probe that measured
// it, and `api/_lib/pro/router.ts` records what it cost. So a dev server that answered a
// two-segment path would be HIDING that defect rather than merely differing - which is exactly
// how hosted Pro shipped three endpoints production refused while every gate stayed green.
//
// Both halves are read off disk. A new function, a new concrete route, a renamed area: none of
// them needs this file edited to be served.
