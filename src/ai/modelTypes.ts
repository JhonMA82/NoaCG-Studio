// Provider-neutral model-call contracts shared by the browser gateway client and the
// server adapters. Creative AI's higher-level AIProvider contract remains the product
// seam; these types only normalize the model transport beneath the existing harness.

// `vercel` is the NoaCG-funded TRANSPORT and nothing else: Vercel AI Gateway's
// OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint, authenticated by an AI Gateway key or the
// deployment's OIDC token (docs/AI_PROVIDER_GATEWAY.md). **It is never offered to a user as a
// choice** - how NoaCG reaches a model on its own money is an implementation detail, and a
// door that names it describes our plumbing instead of the product (owner, 2026-08-14). The
// user-facing list is `AI_PROVIDERS` in settings.ts, which is deliberately a SUBSET of this
// one: the four BRING-YOUR-OWN-KEY providers a user can pay for directly.
