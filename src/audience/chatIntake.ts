// CHAT INTAKE - Twitch / YouTube live chat flowing into a production's audience inbox.
//
// This is the connector doctrine (docs/CLOUD_PLAYOUT.md §7) pointed at the audience plane
// (docs/INTERACTIVE_PLAYOUT_PLAN.md, "Backlog for the audience plane"): a connector is a
// PRODUCER of submissions and nothing else. Every message this module lets through goes in
// through `AudienceBackend.submit` - the same door a phone in the room uses - so an ingested
// chat line is moderated, approved and taken exactly like anything else, and the structural
// rule survives untouched: nothing here can reach the command log, because the interface it
// writes through has no method that does.
//
// ARCHITECTURE, stated because it is a deliberate stopgap: the pollers run in the OPERATOR'S
// BROWSER, the same place the Google-Sheets live-data block runs (control/liveData.ts). That
// keeps the audience plane's zero-Vercel-function architecture; the cost is that ingestion
// lives and dies with the studio tab. The plan doc records server-side per-platform ingestion
// as the eventual shape - this module is v1, not the destination.
//
// IDENTITY: each chat AUTHOR gets a deterministic synthesized device token, so the per-device
// caps (3 per 30 s, mirrored in the DB guard trigger and localAudience.ts) meter per CHAT USER,
// not per connector. One person spamming a chat hits their own cap; the room does not.
//
// VOLUME: a local throttle + dedupe run BEFORE any write. The DB's per-show burst cap is 20
// submissions per 10 s (migration 0035 audience_guard); the intake takes at most HALF of that,
// so a busy chat can never crowd the room's own phones out of the shared burst budget. What
// the throttle refuses is COUNTED and shown - a limiter that drops silently reads as a bug.
// An inbox is read by a human either way: more than ~60 messages a minute is not moderatable,
// so the cap costs the workflow nothing. If a production genuinely needs more, the number to
// change is the DB trigger's, and that is an owner decision, not a connector default.
