 * The WELL behind the mark, painted only when the design's own surface cannot show it.

 * The neutrals are fixed rather than derived from the palette on purpose: the well exists
 * precisely because the palette's surface is the wrong tone, so deriving it from that palette is
 * how it ends up wrong again. Both clear WCAG's 3:1 non-text floor against a pure white or a
 * pure black mark with room to spare, which is what a knockout and a dark lockup actually are.
 *
 * Padding is the clear space the manual asks for, INSIDE the well - so the mark keeps its own
 * air rather than touching the edge of the thing drawn to hold it. Nothing here reaches the
 * picture: no radius, no crop, no filter, no uneven scale, which is what `assetIntegrity.ts`
 * refuses on a mark the user said to use as it is.

/* The logo: a band leading the box, above the text (hidden while empty). Sized by HEIGHT with
   the width left free, so each mark takes exactly the room its own shape needs.

   It was a 56px SQUARE until 2026-08-09, and measured that was false advertising: a square well
   holds a crest and reduces a 4:1 wordmark to a 20px strip and a 10:1 sponsor rail to about 8px
   - and most real brands are wordmarks, so "bring your logo" was true for a shape most users do
   not have (benchmarks/lite/BRAND-AUDIT-2026-08-09.md). A fixed height with an auto width also
   reserves NO empty width when the mark is narrow, which is the trap DESIGN_LANGUAGE §5 names.
   Only a mark past ~4:1 reaches the cap and letterboxes, which is the honest outcome for one.

   NO radius and NO crop, deliberately - a brand mark's corners belong to the brand, and this is
   the slot every 'optional' design inherits. src/ai/assetIntegrity.ts refuses both on a picture
   the user marked "use it as it is", which is what a logo is. */
