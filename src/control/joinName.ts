// Turning a production's NAME into the readable audience link it should already have had.
//
// The owner's rule (docs/INTERACTIVE_PLAYOUT_PLAN.md, Phase 5): a link must exist the moment a
// production is published, derived from its name, without anyone typing an ending. The
// hand-picked name stays - it is just no longer the only way to get a readable URL.
//
// This module holds exactly ONE rule, the slug SHAPE we propose. Every rule about what is
// ACCEPTABLE - the 3-40 length, the character class, the reserved-word list, global uniqueness -
// lives on the column in migration 0035, and `claimJoinName` says at length why a second copy in
// TypeScript would be wrong. So this file never validates a candidate: it proposes one, the
// database answers, and a refusal is simply the next candidate's turn. A base that comes out too
// short ("TV" -> "tv") or reserved ("Admin" -> "admin") is refused and healed by the same retry
// that handles a name someone else already took, with no list here to drift from that one.

/** Room for the `-9` a collision retry appends, inside 0035's 40-character ceiling. */
