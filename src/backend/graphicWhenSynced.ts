// THE LIBRARY RECORD BEHIND A DEEP LINK, including the ones the cloud is still holding.
//
// `#/graphic/<id>` is a link to a record, and the reader who follows it is very often NOT the
// browser that made it: an agent's `noacg save` mints the graphic server-side and prints the link
// (docs/AGENT_SAVE.md), so the studio that opens it has a library from before the save. Looking
// the id up in the local library and giving up is therefore the wrong question asked one moment
// too early - the record is real, it is simply still in the cloud.
//
// This module asks the RIGHT question: is there such a record for this reader, once the cloud has
// had its say? It lives beside the sync controller rather than in the store because answering it
// means driving a sync pass, and the store layer does not reach into `backend/`.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: decide what happens next. A miss can mean "deleted", "someone else's" or
// "nobody is signed in here", and those want different answers on screen - a redirect, a prompt,
// nothing at all. The caller (App.tsx's graphic-route effect, GraphicControlPage) holds that
// decision, which is why this returns a reason rather than performing one.

 * the "deleted graphic lands on Home" case down at all.
 *
 * It is 60 s because a pass is not one round trip. The list comes first, then a `get()` per record
 * actually pulled (the provider's list returns cheap sentinel bodies - backend/supabaseProvider.ts),
 * so a slow network multiplies. Measured 2026-09-16 with every `documents` request held 8 s: the
 * record reached the library at 27 s, and a 20 s ceiling had already given up on it four seconds
 * earlier. On a classroom's shared WiFi that ceiling is the defect all over again.
