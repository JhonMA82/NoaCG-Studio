// The AI CONVERSATION a graphic was created from — the talk turns of the Create-with-AI
// wizard step (components/wizard/steps/AiStep.tsx), captured at create so the graphic carries
// the reasoning that produced it. Persisted BESIDE `aiSpec` (the structured "More control"
// setup): SavedProject.aiThread and GraphicDoc.aiThread, both ADDITIVE OPTIONAL — rule 6 says
// additive fields never bump the version, so this rides the same sync record exactly as aiSpec
// does, no migration.
//
// Deliberately the CONVERSATION only. AiStep also keeps the heavy per-generation snapshots
// behind "↩ Bring back" (full SpxTemplates, asset data-URLs and all), but those are a
// wizard-session exploration affordance the editor has no surface to show — and persisting a
// dozen full templates per graphic would risk the storage quota. The talk turns are the
// lightweight thing that IS "the reasoning", and they feed a later refinement's context
// unchanged (same shape as ai/brainstorm ChatMessage).
