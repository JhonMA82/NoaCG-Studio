/**
 * What an account is FOR, said once.
 *
 * Every surface that asks for an account used to answer the question in its own words - the
 * dialog listed "cloud sync, community and AI", the topbar's tooltip listed the same three in a
 * different order, and Settings listed "cloud sync, publishing, and hosted control pages". Three
 * answers to one question is how a reader concludes nobody knows the answer, and the owner said
 * as much (2026-09-04: "I don't have a really good reason for people to be logged in").
 *
 * The sentence is derived from what a signed-in visitor actually gets today, not from what we
 * would like to promise (src/entitlements/contract.ts FEATURE_KEYS is the full list):
 *   - sync.cloud: the library (graphics, productions, videos) follows the account to any browser;
 *   - ai.*: every AI path on the hosted studio, bring-your-own-key included;
 *   - control.hosted + audience: a published production - the hosted control page a phone can
 *     drive and the persistent output link.
 * Community, teams, agent keys and the ProRes render tier are real too, but they are not what a
 * student two weeks before a show is deciding on, so they stay out of the one sentence. Anything
 * added here must be true of the code, not of the roadmap.
 *
 * The house voice binds (docs.public copy): plain information, no hype, a plain dash never an
 * em dash. scripts/check-copy.mjs gates the tells.
