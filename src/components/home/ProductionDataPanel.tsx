/**
 * ONE EDIT, ONE WRITE — where the text a person is typing lives until the edit is over.
 *
 * Every box on this panel is CONTROLLED by something that is persisted and shared: the value
 * boxes by the production's live tree, the binding boxes by the show record. Writing on every
 * keystroke made each of those cost one write per CHARACTER. On a published production that is
 * one HTTP PATCH per character against an ingest budget of 25 per 5 s, so retyping an
 * eleven-character team name spent half the budget and then started refusing - and the refusal
 * handler pulls the server's older tree back in, which lands in the box still being typed into.
 * A binding box was worse in kind: it persisted every PREFIX of the path as a real binding.
 *
 * So a keystroke stops here. An edit is committed when it is OVER, and it is over on blur, on
 * Enter, after {@link EDIT_SETTLE_MS} of quiet, or when this panel goes away - the last two are
 * what an operator who types the new score and turns back to the desk relies on.
 *
 * THE RULE FOR A BOX BEING TYPED INTO (the revert hazard): while a box holds an uncommitted
 * edit, nothing the tree says changes what that box shows. A feed tick, a second operator and
 * this page's own recovery after a refused write all move the tree, and all of them used to
 * land mid-word. The edit wins its own path when it commits, and every other path keeps
 * whatever arrived meanwhile - the commit writes one path, never the whole tree it was typed
 * against. A box in this state carries `data-dirty`, so the state is visible on screen and
 * assertable in a test rather than being a claim about internals.
 *
 * ONE edit at a time, deliberately: only one box can hold the caret, so a second key means the
 * first edit is finished. Taking a new box over lands the old one rather than dropping it.
