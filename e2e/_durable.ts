// THE SAVED DOCUMENTS LAND A MOMENT AFTER THEY ARE ACCEPTED (src/model/durableStore.ts).
//
// A durable write updates the synchronous in-memory mirror and hands IndexedDB a transaction
// that settles on its own, so a mutator's return means ACCEPTED, not landed. Tearing the
// document down inside that window - `page.reload()`, a `goto`, closing the context - aborts
// whatever has not committed, and the next page reads a library missing exactly the last write
// or two. It is not deterministic WHICH one, which is what makes the resulting failure read as
// a mystery: three graphics saved in a row came back as three, or two, or one.
//
// The product is not what is wrong here. Every surface that tells the user a save succeeded
// already awaits `commitDurableWrites()` before it says so (store/saveActions.ts, the wizard,
// the Home rows, the production page), and the reads are synchronous by design - that is the
// whole reason the mirror exists. What a spec skips when it writes off the UI is that same
// wait, so these two helpers are it: settle before you tear the page down, and - when the read
// after a reload is an `evaluate` rather than a UI assertion - wait for the mirror to be loaded
// before believing what it says.

/**

 * page (createGraphic, addGraphicToShow, setShowHostedSlug, saveProject, …).
 *
 * It claims the failure the way a product surface would, so a refused write surfaces as a
 * named error here instead of a record that silently is not there.
